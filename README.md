# Cpp-Examples
C++ Project with examples and notes from C++ How to Program (9th Edition) book. Also, it includes some extra examples, apart from this book.


**Some Quick Notes**
- `endl` manipulator inserts a **newline** and flushes the stream.
- **Header** files shouldn't include namespaces.
- **unsigned** keyword allows the variable to be only a positive. The integer can never be a negative value
- `default_random_engine` - `srand` functions change the seed(starting point) of the random number generator algorithm.
